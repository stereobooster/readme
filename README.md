# About me

## My work

I believe type systems can help to prevent a lot of annoying bugs, I explored this idea recently. The challenge is to be able to convince people that types are actually useful. Here is my attempt: [stereobooster/pragmatic-types](https://github.com/stereobooster/pragmatic-types).

I appreciate and admire the carefully designed user experience. Here is an example of how much into details I can go about UX: [An Almost Ideal React Image Component](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-ideal-image/blob/master/introduction.md)

I consider performance to be part of the user experience. Here is an example of what I can do to make sure performance is good enough: [how much faster you can make "An Almost Static Stack"](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap/blob/master/doc/an-almost-static-stack-optimization.md)

I grateful for open source, which helps me (and million other developers) to do my job. I contribute back as much as possible. Some repositories I contributed back and got colaborator access to the repository: [downshift](https://github.com/paypal/downshift), [css-in-js](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js), [minimalcss](https://github.com/peterbe/minimalcss).
